For my final project, I will be creating a "Squishmallow Collection" website. The website will allow users to 
have a collection displaying all of the Squishmallows they own, find recommendations based on what they don't yet have, 
add friends, as well as list Squishmallows for selling and earn special badges. Instead of using an API I will be prepopulating a database
with Squishmallows. The webapp will require user/profile creation, and therefore the 
start page will be a login page. It will require the following models and relationships:

Profiles:
    - User (fk to users via django admin)
    - profile_pic (image)
    - first_name (text)
    - last_name (text)
    - fav_squish (fk to Squishmallow)
Squishmallows:
    - name (text)
    - type (text)
    - size (integer)
    - birthday (datetime)
    - collected_date (datetime)
Listings:
    - owner (fk to Profile)
    - squishmallow (fk to Squishmallow) 
    - price (integer)
Badges:
    - badge_name (text)
    - badge_holder (fk to Profile)
