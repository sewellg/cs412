For my final project, I will be creating a "Music Taste Profile" website. The website will allow users to 
create playlists, find song recommendations, add friends with similar tastes, and ideally will also include
a music player at the bottom of the page (similar to Spotify). Ideally, the webapp will use Spotify's API
to prepopulate the database with songs. The webapp will require user/profile creation, and therefore the 
start page will be a login page. It will require the following models and relationships:

Profiles:
    - User (fk to users via django admin)
    - profile_pic (image)
    - first_name (text)
    - last_name (text)
    - fav_genre (fk to genre)
    - fav_song (fk to song)
    - fav_artist (fk to artist)
Genres:
    - genre_name (text)
Songs:
    - song_name (text)
    - artist (fk to artist)
Artists:
    - name (text)
    - genre (fk to genre)
